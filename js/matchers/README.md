# Matchers facilities - JavaScript

## Overview

Matchers utilise some specific elements from MARC bibliographic records to generate a unique string which identifies common records that describe the same instance.

The matchers in this directory are implemented with JavaScript.

Takes input being a MARC-in-JSON string of MARC fields, and returns the matchkey string.

Each component of the matchkey is padded with the underscore character to fill to its field width.
